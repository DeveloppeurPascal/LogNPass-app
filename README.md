# Log'n Pass (desktop software and mobile application)

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Source code of the [Log'n Pass](https://lognpass.fr) application  providing unique access codes (OTP - one time password) for software and sites referenced through the Log'n Pass API.

How it works:
* List the sites or software to protect in the interface
* Reference your secret phrases
* Add the secret phrases on your user account on compatible software and sites

Once done, you just have to generate a temporary code when you need to connect.

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Protect your sites and programs

If you want to implement Log'n Pass in your sites or programs, you just need to add a text field (or several) to your user accounts to enter the pass phrase used to generate the codes.

This phrase or series of letters and numbers must be generated on your side and re-entered in the application or preferably left free for your users to enter what they want.

To control access with Log'n Pass, you just have to use one of [our development kits](https://lognpass.fr/c/_3-integrer.html) or add your own. The implementation is not very complicated.

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/LogNPass-app).

This project uses dependencies in the form of sub-modules. They will be absent from the ZIP file. You'll have to download them by hand.

* [DeveloppeurPascal/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component) in the sub folder ./lib-externes/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component
* [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies) in the sub folder ./lib-externes/librairies
* [DeveloppeurPascal/LogNPass-Delphi](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/LogNPass-Delphi) in the sub folder ./lib-externes/LogNPass-Delphi

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/LogNPass-app/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
